    <h2>System Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Library Book Management System is a static web interface designed to 
      efficiently organize and manage library resources. This system allows 
      administrators to keep track of all books, their availability status, and 
      related details such as author, category, and book ID. It also helps in 
      monitoring members, recording issued books, and maintaining a structured 
      database of library activities. While this version is purely static and 
      built with HTML and CSS, it simulates the layout and functionality of a 
      real management system, providing a clear and user-friendly interface 
      for navigating through the library data.
